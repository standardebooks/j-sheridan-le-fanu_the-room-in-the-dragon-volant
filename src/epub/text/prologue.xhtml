			<h2 epub:type="title">Prologue</h2>
			<p>The curious case which I am about to place before you, is referred to, very pointedly, and more than once, in the extraordinary essay upon the drugs of the Dark and the Middle Ages, from the pen of Doctor Hesselius.</p>
			<p>This essay he entitles “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.essay" xml:lang="la">Mortis Imago</span>,” and he, therein, discusses the <i xml:lang="la">Vinum letiferum</i>, the <i xml:lang="la">Beatifica</i>, the <i xml:lang="la">Somnus Angelorum</i>, the <i xml:lang="la">Hypnus Sagarum</i>, the <i xml:lang="la">Aqua Thessalliæ</i>, and about twenty other infusions and distillations, well known to the sages of eight hundred years ago, and two of which are still, he alleges, known to the fraternity of thieves, and, among them, as police-office inquiries sometimes disclose to this day, in practical use.</p>
			<p>The essay, “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.essay" xml:lang="la">Mortis Imago</span>,” will occupy as nearly as I can, at present, calculate, two volumes, the ninth and tenth, of the collected papers of Doctor Martin Hesselius.</p>
			<p>This essay, I may remark, in conclusion, is very curiously enriched by citations, in great abundance, from medieval verse and prose romance, some of the most valuable of which, strange to say, are Egyptian.</p>
			<p>I have selected this particular statement from among many cases equally striking, but hardly, I think, so effective as mere narratives, in this irregular form of publication, it is simply as a story that I present it.</p>
